Reference Mutation Artifact Demonstration

This script demonstrates how fixed-length reference alignment
introduces artificial reference mutations instead of capturing
true genetic variants in aDNA sequences.

The user correctly identified: "this is due to the alignment with fixed size
length using reference, retrieving reference mutations"
