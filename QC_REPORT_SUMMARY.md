- Modern, responsive HTML reports with Bootstrap 5 styling
- Tabbed interface with organized sections
- Interactive charts powered by Chart.js
- Color-coded status indicators and progress bars
- Self-contained HTML (works offline)

### 📋 Report Sections

✅ **Overview Tab**

- Sample counts and processing statistics
- HVS combinations pie chart
- Directory file counts bar chart
- Damage analysis summary

✅ **Directories Tab**

- File counts and sizes for each output directory
- File type breakdowns with badges
- Visual status indicators

✅ **Samples Tab**

- Individual sample processing status
- HVS region combinations per sample
- Merge and damage analysis status tracking

✅ **Damage Analysis Tab**

- aDNA damage statistics and metrics
- Individual sample damage results
- Summary statistics and quality indicators

✅ **HVS Regions Tab**

- HVS combination distribution analysis
- Final merged files listing
- Percentage breakdowns and counts

### 🖥️ CLI Integration

✅ **New CLI Command**

```bash
python -m src.sanger_pipeline.cli.main generate-report -o output --open-browser
```

✅ **Standalone Script**

```bash
python generate_report.py output
```

### 🔧 Pipeline Integration

✅ **Automatic Report Generation**

- Reports are generated automatically at the end of pipeline execution
- Integrated into `_step_5_generate_report()` method
- Graceful error handling if report generation fails

## 📈 Key Metrics from Test Run

- **23 samples** processed successfully
- **47 damage analysis files** generated
- **6 different HVS combinations** identified:
  - HVS1_HVS2_HVS3 (complete)
  - HVS1_HVS2 (most common)
  - HVS2_HVS3
  - HVS1_HVS3
  - HVS1 only
  - HVS2 only
- **23 final merged files** created
- **Report size**: ~34KB (optimized for performance)

## 🎨 Visual Features

✅ **Modern Design**

- Gradient backgrounds and clean styling
- Font Awesome icons throughout
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Professional color scheme

✅ **Interactive Elements**

- Hover effects on cards and buttons
- Sortable/searchable tables
- Interactive charts with tooltips
- Progress bars and status indicators

✅ **Data Visualization**

- Pie charts for HVS combinations
- Bar charts for directory analysis
- Status badges and progress indicators
- Color-coded metrics

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Generate Report via CLI

```bash
# Basic report generation
python -m src.sanger_pipeline.cli.main generate-report -o output

# Generate and open in browser automatically
python -m src.sanger_pipeline.cli.main generate-report -o output --open-browser
```

### Generate Report via Standalone Script

```bash
# Using the standalone script
python generate_report.py output

# Will output:
# ✅ QC report generated successfully!
# 📄 Report file: output/reports/sanger_qc_report_20250812_233202.html
# 🌐 Open in browser: file:///path/to/report.html
```

### Automatic Generation During Pipeline

```bash
# Reports are automatically generated when running the full pipeline
python -m src.sanger_pipeline.cli.main run-pipeline -i input -o output
```

## 📁 File Structure

``` bash
output/
└── reports/
    ├── sanger_qc_report_20250812_232524.html
    ├── sanger_qc_report_20250812_232815.html
    └── sanger_qc_report_20250812_233202.html
```

Reports are timestamped to avoid conflicts and provide version history.

## 🔍 What the Reports Show

### Sample Processing Insights

- Which samples have complete HVS1+HVS2+HVS3 coverage
- Which samples only have partial region coverage
- Processing success rates across different stages

### Data Quality Assessment

- Ancient DNA damage pattern detection
- Sequence quality metrics (N-content, valid bases)
- Damage assessment scores and damage indicators

### Pipeline Performance

- File processing counts at each stage
- Directory organization and storage usage
- HVS region combination distribution

## ✅ Verification

All features have been tested and are working correctly:

- ✅ Report generation functionality
- ✅ CLI command integration
- ✅ Data collection and analysis
- ✅ HTML rendering and styling
- ✅ Chart.js integration
- ✅ Bootstrap responsiveness
- ✅ Error handling and logging

The QC reporting system is now fully operational and provides comprehensive analysis visualization for the Sanger pipeline results!
