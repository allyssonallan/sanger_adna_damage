# Documentation Updates Summary

## 📁 File Organization

### ✅ Implementation Files Moved
- Created new directory: `docs/implementation/`
- Moved technical implementation files from root to organized location:
  - `STRAND_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md`
  - `SEQUENCE_LENGTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` 
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Added comprehensive `README.md` index for implementation docs

## 🚨 Important Disclaimers Added

### Tool Purpose Clarification
Added prominent disclaimers throughout documentation emphasizing that this pipeline is **NOT** for aDNA authentication, but for:

- **Prioritizing haplogroups** for follow-up analysis
- **Evaluating sample quality** based on insert size and damage patterns
- **Providing surrogate bootstrapped damage indicators**
- **Assisting in haplogroup origin assessment**  
- **Guiding selection** of promising samples for NGS sequencing

### Files Updated with Disclaimers

#### 📖 Main Documentation (`docs/source/`)
1. **`index.rst`** - Added prominent `.. important::` box on main documentation landing page
2. **`quickstart.rst`** - Added `.. warning::` box in quick start guide
3. **`installation.rst`** - Added `.. note::` box about tool purpose
4. **`tutorials/first_analysis.rst`** - Added `.. attention::` box in main tutorial
5. **`understanding_damage_analysis.rst`** - Added critical `.. danger::` box on damage analysis page
6. **`configuration.rst`** - Added `.. tip::` box about configuration purpose

#### 📝 README.md
- Added prominent GitHub-style warning box with important disclaimer
- Fixed markdown formatting issues (trailing spaces)

## 🎯 Key Messages Communicated

### What This Tool IS Good For:
- ✅ Sample prioritization and screening
- ✅ Quality assessment for NGS planning
- ✅ Resource allocation guidance
- ✅ Preliminary haplogroup assessment
- ✅ Insert size evaluation

### What This Tool is NOT:
- ❌ Definitive aDNA authentication
- ❌ Replacement for NGS-based analysis
- ❌ Publication-quality authentication without NGS
- ❌ Suitable without proper controls and contamination assessment

## 📍 Strategic Placement

Disclaimers are placed in high-visibility locations:
- Main documentation landing page
- Quick start guide (where users begin)
- Installation page (early in user journey)
- Main tutorial (most-used learning resource)
- Damage analysis page (where scientific claims might be misinterpreted)
- Configuration guide (where parameters are set)
- README.md (first thing users see on GitHub)

## 💡 Benefits

1. **Clear Expectations**: Users understand tool limitations from the start
2. **Proper Usage**: Guides users toward appropriate applications
3. **Scientific Rigor**: Prevents misapplication for authentication
4. **Legal Protection**: Clear disclaimers about tool scope and limitations
5. **Better Science**: Encourages proper NGS-based authentication workflows
