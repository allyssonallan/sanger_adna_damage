# âœ… GitHub Actions Updated - Deprecated Actions Fixed!

## The Issue
GitHub Actions was failing with:
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`
```

## âœ… What's Fixed

### **Updated Action Versions**
- âœ… `actions/setup-python`: `v4` â†’ `v5`
- âœ… `actions/configure-pages`: `v3` â†’ `v4`  
- âœ… `actions/upload-pages-artifact`: `v2` â†’ `v3`
- âœ… `actions/deploy-pages`: `v2` â†’ `v4`

### **Current Workflow Status**
- âœ… **No deprecated actions** - All actions are latest versions
- âœ… **Proper permissions** - Pages deployment permissions configured
- âœ… **Custom domain support** - CNAME file automatically created
- âœ… **Modern deployment** - Uses GitHub's official Pages actions

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment!

Your GitHub Actions workflow is now fully updated and should run successfully. The workflow will:

1. âœ… **Build documentation** with Sphinx + Furo theme
2. âœ… **Create CNAME file** for `allysson.dev.br`
3. âœ… **Upload artifact** using latest actions
4. âœ… **Deploy to Pages** with proper permissions

## ðŸ“‹ Repository Settings Still Needed

**Don't forget to configure your repository settings:**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/allyssonallan/sanger_adna_damage/settings/pages`
2. Under **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Under **Custom domain**: Enter `allysson.dev.br`
4. Click **Save**

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Result

After configuring repository settings, your documentation will be automatically deployed to:
**`https://allysson.dev.br/sanger_adna_damage/`**

The workflow is now using the latest, non-deprecated GitHub Actions and should deploy successfully! ðŸŽ‰
